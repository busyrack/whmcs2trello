#WHMCS to Trello Integration

Get Support tickets into a Trello list. If a WHMCS Support Department is set up, then only new tickets for this department as well as tickets re-assigned to this department will be sent to trello. Otherwise - all new tickets will be sent. 

When the "cc_card" checkbox is set, WHMCS will add the new Trello card email address as cc to the ticket. 

At Globaldots, we use this extension to send only 2nd tier support tickets to the 2nd tier Trello board. 

## Dependencies

* php5-curl 
* Working WHMCS installation

## Installation

To install you need to copy the files to

WHMCS_ROOT/modules/addons/whmcs2trello

Once the files have successfully uploaded navigate to the WHMCS administration area and click (Setup > Addon Modules)

Here you will see a list of modules that have been uploaded, within this list you will see "WHMCS to Trello". Click the 'Activate' link to begin setting up the module.


## Configuration
There is no configuration beyond the module configuration screen. 

`Trello Key` This is available here https://trello.com/app-key

`Trello Token` This must be generated by following this link https://trello.com/1/authorize?expiration=never&scope=read,write,account&response_type=token&name=WHMCS&key=REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-KEY

`Trello List ID` Navigate to the board you want to use, add .json at end of URL. Use the "idList" attribute of the list you want to use. 
Alternatively, get the group id from the "id" attribute and use the following URL: https://api.trello.com/1/boards/REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-GROUP-ID?lists=open&list_fields=name&fields=name,desc&key=REPLACE-WITH-YOUR-KEY&token=REPLACE-WITH-YOUR_TOKEN

## Bugs
* WHMCS hook `TicketDepartmentChange` does not allow modification of ticket cc. There is an open ticket with WHMCS support about it. 

## To do
* Reflect in Trello the entire ticket lifecycle including all comments, changes and closing.
